Network sniffer and debugger



## What Does This Program Do?

Sharkpy is a powerful network tool that allows you to explore, analyze, and take control of data traffic on a network. Think of it as a super-spy that helps you understand what's happening on your network and have some interesting (in a good way!) adventures along the way.


## Key Features:

- **Network Sniffing:** Sharkpy can sniff data traffic on your network. With its fancy GUI, Sharkpy presents data traffic in a visual style similar to Wireshark, making it easy to comprehend and analyze.

- **Network Debugging:** Sharkpy provides amazing capabilities to debug network packets. Like Burp Suite, Sharkpy acts as a powerful intermediary. However, it's not limited to web traffic but can control and modify traffic at any network layer and protocol (where supported), giving you unparalleled control.

- **Network Security:** Sharkpy  also empowers you to perform Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attacks, where you can intercept and modify traffic, making it a versatile tool for security testing.
